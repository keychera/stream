# idea - first article

-> introduce kotlin as a test automation solution

motivation/target audience

-> so if we look for tutorials or anything regarding on how to write an automated test scripts, there are a lot of them that uses Java
-> one problem that Java has is the verbose syntax
-> kotlin can be an alternative language to write the automation code
    why is that
    - more concise syntax
    - can be incrementally added/introduced to existing Java project
    - allows for more elegant abstraction
      - I want to introduce later on about the library that I wrote (Selenium/Appium wrapper, Page Object Model wrapper, etc.)
    - need more pros here


article order/structure/flow

-> that intro regarding Java test automation
-> introduce kotlin that is a JVM language with above pros/values props
-> how it looks when it's done

-> step by step how to include kotlin to your existing java project <== THE WAY
    -> how to start from kotlin from the scratch (should we make it separate?)

-> about the cons
-> introducing my article series which actually will lead to unveiling the framework(?) to make test automation

-> mimic a Java tutorial and make a kotlin version of it(?) 



unfortunately, when you search kotlin in google, it's always synonymous with mobile dev, even though it's a general purpose language. so it's a little bit harder if you try to solve problems with it when it's not used as a mobile dev


# meta - stream

- will invite my friend to join and gives like impression and stuff
- i want to make this consistent (I am thinking of doing this every night if possible)
- after the one article is done, I want to really publicize this stream series or this channel via:
  - linkedin (... my very first article blabla, the process is livestreamed fully something2)
  - X(æ—§Twitter) ... just my ususal japanese post
  - facebook
  
- idea that I want to implement in this stream
  - idea 1
    - I want to outline the goal of the stream in the beginning
    - write them down somewhere that is accessible via URL
    - put the URL on the stream screen so viewer can see the general topic/theme of the current stream
  - livecoding but this will come naturally i think
  - need to find stuff like trello, gdocs or another live tools that can be accessed by public easily



# Article series

1. "If you use Java for Test Automation, try Kotlin!"
not in order....
2. "3 Important things in Test Automation that I have yet to achieve"
3. "Page Object Model in Kotlin" --> the library that I named Journey
.... still hazy for now
