# lib pub

the goal is to find out how to publish a library

    - what we need to prep
      - javadoc
      - file checksums
      - PGP signature
      - sufficient metadata
      - name (group artifact version)
      - license
      - dev info
      - scm

- look back at the code and maybe reorganize them to prepare for lib publishing (that journey code)
