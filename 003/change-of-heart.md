# change of heart!

initial plan:
1. write an article introducing kotlin, and then write a number of followup article, paving towards me introducing my own test framework

now the plan is:
1. I want to focus on Journey, which a name of a library I made that is an alternative abstraction of POM (Page Object Model)
   1. so the first article would actually be showcasing this library and how it would differ from the usual Page Object Model 
        - the (kinda) problem is: I have never actually properly used the well known POM, so I want to browse some tutorial regarding this
        - I found some people as well in LinkedIn sharing their learning results of them learning test automation including POM, the tutorial they used can be referred as well 

steps now are
1. kinda finish the library
2. look for tutorials of POM
3. write POM and the comparison between Journey and POM
4. write the article
